# Nature_image_classification
This project develops an end-to-end pipeline using the Intel Image Classification dataset from Kaggle (Kaggle, n.d.), comprising six classes (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street) each with challenges of variability and high dimensionality.

## Background
This project was created in 2025,March. This was a projected worked on during my courses at my time in UCL and has served as my initial image classification work.
The code was run mostly on local Jupyter notebooks with some parts of the Neural Networks being run on Google Colab for GPU usage.
